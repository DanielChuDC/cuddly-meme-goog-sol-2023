### Technology used
1. Angular with Progressive Web App
2. Firebase with ML kit, firestore
3. Google Cloud engine to deploy Geth
4. Documents AI
5. Google Cloud Storage for storing image
6. Terraform and ansible to create infra in Google Cloud
7. Using Geth and solidity to create smart contract




### Project goal
To Improvements in the efficiency of resource use and provide verifiable ways for sharing resources with AI and blockchain

Quality Education, Sustainable Cities and Communities, Responsible Consumption and Production, Climate Action. By providing verifiable way of sharing more resource which current no competitor, we can promote the following point :

Quality Education (SDG 4): Quality education is crucial for sustainable development and reducing poverty. By ensuring access to quality education, we can empower individuals and communities to make informed decisions and take action towards a better future.
Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11): Sustainable cities and communities are key to addressing challenges such as climate change and poverty. By promoting sustainable urbanization, we can ensure that cities are safe, resilient, and sustainable places for everyone to live and work.
Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12): Responsible consumption and production involves reducing waste and promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns. By using resources more efficiently and reducing waste, we can reduce our impact on the environment and promote sustainable development.
Climate Action (SDG 13): Climate action is essential for addressing the global challenge of climate change. By taking urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience to the impacts of climate change, we can ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.



### Implementation

Frontend: This frontend component is responsible for providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application. In this case, Angular is used as the frontend framework to build the user interface and ensure smooth navigation and responsiveness.

Backend: This backend component is responsible for processing user requests and providing the appropriate response. Firebase is used as the backend service, which provides features such as authentication, database, and machine learning kit (ML kit) for processing images and text.

Google Cloud Engine: Google Cloud Engine to deploy Geth, which is an Ethereum node implementation. Geth is responsible for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and executing smart contracts written in Solidity.

Documents AI: This is responsible for generating and processing documents and extracting relevant information from them. 

Google Cloud Storage: Google Cloud Storage is used to store images and other files. This component is responsible for providing secure and reliable storage for the application's data.

Terraform and Ansible: Terraform and Ansible are used to create the infrastructure in Google Cloud. Terraform is responsible for provisioning and managing resources, while Ansible is used for configuration management and deployment.

Smart Contract: Using Geth and Solidity to create smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that can be used to automate various processes.
